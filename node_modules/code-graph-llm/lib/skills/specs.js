BEFORE calling Read, Grep, Glob, or any file inspection tool:
1. Read \`${CONFIG.MAP_FILE}\` — the canonical index of all files, symbols, and dependency edges.
2. Use it to identify exactly which files to open. Do not guess. Do not search blindly.
3. Use god nodes (*) to locate entry points and high-impact files.
4. Use the EDGES section to understand dependencies before modifying anything.
5. Refresh with \`code-graph generate\` after adding, removing, or renaming files.

Inspecting raw files without first reading \`${CONFIG.MAP_FILE}\` = task failure.

function simplicityBody() {

BEFORE writing any code, ask: does the task require this?

- Write ONLY what the task requires. Nothing more.
- NO extra parameters, config options, or flags beyond what is asked.
- NO abstractions unless the code literally cannot work without them.
- NO helper functions for logic used in exactly one place.
- NO error handling for cases that cannot happen in the current context.
- NO comments explaining what the code does — name things well instead.
- PREFER the shorter solution. Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction.
- If asked to fix a bug: fix the bug only. Do not refactor. Do not improve.

The simplest correct solution is the right solution. Every extra line is a liability.
`;

BEFORE planning or writing code:

- Ask for clarification when ambiguity changes architecture, data shape, public API, security, or user-visible behavior.
- Push back when a simpler approach meets the goal.
- If confused, stop and name what is unclear before editing.
- For trivial one-line changes, use judgment and keep this lightweight.

Hidden assumptions are task failures. Surface uncertainty early.

BEFORE making any change, identify the minimum diff that satisfies the task.

- DO NOT add logging, validation, or error handling that was not asked for.
- DO NOT "improve" or "clean up" code you happen to touch.
- DO NOT change whitespace, quotes, or formatting outside your diff.
- MATCH the existing style exactly: indentation, naming, spacing, quote style.
- If your change breaks a nearby comment or reference, fix only that breakage.
- Remove imports, variables, functions, or files that YOUR change made unused.
- Mention pre-existing dead code if relevant, but do not delete it unless asked.
- Leave all other code exactly as you found it.

The smallest correct diff is the right diff. Scope creep = task failure.

WHEN adding or changing any dependency, package, framework, SDK, API, method, function, or integration:

- Use the latest stable release that is compatible with the project.
- Verify current usage against official documentation, package metadata, or the project's lockfile before choosing versions or APIs.
- DO NOT use deprecated packages, methods, functions, configuration keys, CLI flags, import paths, or patterns.
- DO NOT pin old versions unless the project already requires that version or the user explicitly asks for it.
- DO NOT copy stale examples from memory when dependency behavior may have changed.
- Prefer maintained first-party libraries over abandoned or unofficial packages.
- If the project already uses an older dependency, preserve compatibility unless the task requires an upgrade; do not silently mix incompatible major versions.
- If a deprecated choice is unavoidable, state the reason and the migration path.
- If you repeat a deprecated or stale choice after being corrected, STOP. Re-read ${CONFIG.RULES_FILE}, state that FreshDeps is mandatory, and replace the choice with the current stable approach before continuing.

Latest stable and non-deprecated APIs are mandatory. Stale dependency choices = task failure.
`;

function contextBudgetBody() {

AFTER each completed phase, every 10 tool calls, or before changing direction:

1. Write a compact rolling summary of the current goal, decisions, files inspected or changed, commands run, verification status, blockers, and next step.
2. Keep only facts needed for the next action. Drop raw logs, repeated source excerpts, and stale branches of reasoning unless they affect the next decision.
3. Prefer file paths, symbols, line numbers, and references to ${CONFIG.MAP_FILE} over pasted source content.
4. When command output matters, preserve the exact error, failing assertion, or version line only.
5. Before final response, use the latest summary instead of replaying the full transcript.

Context summaries should be short, factual, and actionable. Large copied context is a task failure when a smaller summary would preserve the decision.
