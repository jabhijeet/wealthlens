# CODE-GRAPH (v4.19.0)

> Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills), [juliusbrussee/caveman](https://github.com/juliusbrussee/caveman), and the community's work building better agent workflows.

A language-agnostic, ultra-compact codebase mapper and **agent memory system** for LLM agents. Code-Graph gives agents a compact file, symbol, and dependency index, then pairs it with persistent project learnings so agents can avoid repeating mistakes across sessions.

## New in v4.19.0

- **Fix (Generate — large file hang):** Files over 100KB now skip symbol extraction instead of running the regex parser. Compiled/generated files like `drift_worker.js` (343KB Dart→JS) caused catastrophic regex backtracking that blocked the Node.js event loop entirely, preventing timeouts and heartbeats from firing. Large files are still indexed in the graph with their description; only symbol extraction is skipped.
- **Fix (Generate — file timeout reduced):** Per-file timeout reduced from 15s to 5s. Timed-out files are now logged as errors (`console.error`) instead of warnings.
- **Fix (Generate — readdir timeout):** Directory reads (`readdir`) now have an 8s timeout. If a directory hangs (e.g. broken symlink, network path), the scanner logs an error and skips it instead of blocking forever.
- **UX (Generate — elapsed timestamps):** Every `Scanning:` log line now shows elapsed time since generation started (e.g. `+0.3s`), making it easy to spot which directory is slow.
- **UX (Generate — heartbeat):** A `Still scanning...` heartbeat fires every 5s during the walk phase, confirming the process is alive on large repos.
- **UX (Generate — per-file processing log):** Each file logs `Processing: <path>` before parse begins, so if the process hangs the last visible line identifies the culprit file.
- **UX (Generate — skip summary):** End-of-run summary lists every skipped file with reason (`large-no-parse`, `file-timeout`, `readdir-timeout`, `oversized`, `permission`, `exception`).

## Installation

```bash
# Global installation (recommended for CLI usage)
npm install -g code-graph-llm

# Project-level installation
npm install --save-dev code-graph-llm
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Check version and help
code-graph --version
code-graph --help

# 1. Initialize rules and memory
code-graph init

# 2. Build the graph
code-graph generate

# 3. Install all bundled skills for one agent
code-graph install-skills claude

# 4. Or install globally for all projects
code-graph install-skills -g claude
```

Every install prints each target it writes:

```text
[Code-Graph v4.19.0] Installed/updated: /absolute/path/to/AGENTS.md
[Code-Graph v4.19.0] Installed/updated: /absolute/path/to/.codex/hooks.json
```

## Core Concepts

Code-Graph operates in two modes: **Passive Skills** and **Active Agents**.

| Mode | Paradigm | Benefit | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unified** | Both | Installs skills and the active agent together. | `code-graph install <platform>` |
| **Skills** | Passive Context | Injects the graph and memory rules into the agent's normal workflow. | `code-graph install-skills <platform>` |
| **Agents** | Active Delegation | Registers `code-graph` as a specialized sub-agent. | `code-graph install-agent <platform>` |

### Unified Installation

Get the full Code-Graph experience by installing both skills and the active sub-agent in one command.

```bash
code-graph install gemini
```

Uninstall with:

```bash
code-graph uninstall <platform>
```

### Passive Skills

Skills are always-on configurations that tell your agent how to use the project map and memory files. `code-graph install-skills <platform>` installs all bundled skills by default for every supported platform.

- **ProjectMap:** Reads `llm-code-graph.md`, the canonical file, symbol, and dependency index, before raw file searches.
- **Reflections:** Reads and updates `llm-agent-project-learnings.md` so agents retain project-specific lessons.
- **ThinkBeforeCoding:** Surfaces assumptions, ambiguity, tradeoffs, and simpler options before non-trivial work.
- **Simplicity:** Keeps changes limited to what the task actually requires.
- **SurgicalChanges:** Prevents unrelated refactors, style churn, and scope creep while allowing cleanup caused by your own diff.
- **GoalDriven:** Forces explicit success criteria and verification before completion.
- **FreshDeps:** Forces latest stable compatible dependencies and current, non-deprecated APIs.
- **ContextBudget:** Periodically condenses working context to reduce token load and stale detail.

```bash
# Install all bundled skills
code-graph install-skills gemini

# Install one skill
code-graph install-skills cursor projectmap

# Install only dependency freshness rules
code-graph install-skills codex freshdeps

# Install surgical diff rules (CLI alias remains changelimit-compatible)
code-graph install-skills claude surgicalchanges

# Uninstall one skill
code-graph uninstall-skills claude reflections

# Uninstall all skills for a platform
code-graph uninstall-skills claude
```

### Active Agents

Agents are specialized personas. Instead of only reading project files, a main orchestrator such as Gemini CLI or Claude Code can delegate mapping and analysis work to the Code-Graph agent.

```bash
# Register code-graph as a sub-agent
code-graph install-agent claude

# Example delegation:
# "Hey code-graph, analyze the dependency chain of the auth module."
```

Uninstall with:

```bash
code-graph uninstall-agent <platform>
```

Claude Code receives focused sub-agents when available:

- `code-graph`: General project-map and reflection specialist.
- `code-graph-locator`: Finds the smallest relevant file and symbol set before raw source reads.
- `code-graph-tracer`: Traces dependency and inheritance paths from `## EDGES`.
- `code-graph-reviewer`: Checks map freshness, reflection coverage, scope creep, and dependency freshness.

## Supported Platforms

Use `-g` before the platform to install skills globally. Without `-g`, skills are installed for the current project when the platform supports project-level instructions.

## Platform Integration Details

Every supported platform receives all bundled skills when installing all skills. Platforms with native skill or rule formats get native artifacts; the rest receive the same mandatory instructions through their project instruction file, usually `AGENTS.md`.

| Platform | Action Taken | Directory / Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude Code** | Injects instructions and installs `PreToolUse` hooks for `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob`; agent install creates split Code-Graph sub-agents. | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/` |
| **Cursor** | Writes always-on `.mdc` rule files for each bundled skill with `alwaysApply: true`. | `.cursor/rules/` |
| **Gemini CLI** | Installs global skills with YAML frontmatter and `GEMINI.md` memory imports. | `~/.gemini/skills/`, `GEMINI.md` |
| **Antigravity** | Writes always-on skills and rules locally, plus the specialized Code-Graph agent skill globally. | `.agent/skills/`, `.agent/rules/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/code-graph/` |
| **Kiro IDE/CLI** | Writes steering files locally; the specialized Code-Graph agent is registered globally. | `.kiro/steering/`, `~/.kiro/agents/code-graph/` |
| **Codex** | Updates `AGENTS.md` and installs enabled nested `PreToolUse` hooks for `Bash`. | `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/hooks.json` |
| **OpenCode** | Registers per-skill plugins and preserves existing plugin entries. | `AGENTS.md`, `.opencode/plugins/`, `opencode.json` |
| **Roo Code** | Injects instructions into project rule files. | `.clinerules`, `.roorules` |
| **IntelliJ / JetBrains** | Adds architectural context to a discoverable file. | `AGENTS.md` |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Copies skills globally for persistence. | `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| **VS Code Copilot** | Writes session-persistent instructions. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Aider / Trae / Others** | Updates project instructions and copies skills globally when supported. | `AGENTS.md`, `~/.<platform>/skills/` |

## Agent Workflow

Instruct your agent to follow the strict protocol in `llm-agent-rules.md`:

1. Treat every bundled skill as mandatory: ProjectMap, Reflections, ThinkBeforeCoding, Simplicity, SurgicalChanges, GoalDriven, FreshDeps, and ContextBudget.
2. Read `llm-agent-project-learnings.md` before starting any task.
3. Read `llm-code-graph.md` before raw file searches or architecture analysis.
4. Surface assumptions and ambiguity before non-trivial work.
5. Define success criteria and report verification results or blockers.
6. Use latest stable compatible dependencies and current APIs; avoid deprecated packages, methods, functions, flags, and patterns.
7. Update reflections after failures, corrections, repeated mistakes, or non-obvious project behavior.
8. Regenerate `llm-code-graph.md` after structural code changes.

Recommended generic prompt:

```text
Before acting, read llm-code-graph.md and follow llm-agent-rules.md. Treat all bundled skills as mandatory. Use latest stable compatible dependencies and current APIs; avoid deprecated choices. If you encounter a bug, environment quirk, or reusable project lesson, record it with code-graph reflect <CAT> <LESSON>.
```

### Reading the Map

`llm-code-graph.md` is a compact index generated from the project. Each file entry is designed to help an agent decide which files matter before opening raw source:

- `*` marks a core entry point or high-importance file.
- `(↑out ↓in)` shows dependency counts. Outgoing dependencies are files or packages this file references; incoming dependencies are files that reference it.
- `d:` is a short description extracted from file comments or nearby context.
- `s:` lists important symbols found in the file, such as classes, functions, types, and exported values.
- The `## EDGES` section lists dependency relationships in the form `[source] -> [targets]`.

For example:

```markdown
- *src/auth.js (3↑ 5↓) [TODO:Add JWT rotation] | d: Handles user authentication.
  - s: [login [(username, password)], validateToken [(token: string)]]

## EDGES
[src/auth.js] -> [jwt-lib, db-connector]
[AdminUser] -> [BaseUser]
```

This means `src/auth.js` is a core file with 3 outgoing dependencies and 5 incoming references. It contains the `login` and `validateToken` symbols, has a TODO about JWT rotation, depends on `jwt-lib` and `db-connector`, and includes an inheritance relationship where `AdminUser` extends or implements `BaseUser`.

## Sub-Agent Registration

Register `code-graph` as an active sub-agent to enable explicit delegation.

| Platform | Command | Action Taken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini CLI** | `code-graph install-agent gemini` | Registers global agent in `~/.gemini/agents/code-graph.md`. |
| **Claude Code** | `code-graph install-agent claude` | Registers split sub-agents in `.claude/agents/`: `code-graph`, `code-graph-locator`, `code-graph-tracer`, and `code-graph-reviewer`. |
| **Antigravity** | `code-graph install-agent antigravity` | Registers agent skill in `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`. |
| **Kiro IDE/CLI** | `code-graph install-agent kiro` | Registers agent in `~/.kiro/agents/`. |
| **Generic Agent** | `code-graph install-agent generic` | Generates `.code-graph-agent.md` persona prompt. |

## Implementation Details

index.js              CLI entry point and public re-exports
lib/
  config.js           Constants, regex patterns, shared utilities
  parser.js           CodeParser: symbol, edge, and tag extraction
  mapper.js           ProjectMapper: file walking and graph generation
  reflections.js      ReflectionManager: lesson persistence
  initializer.js      ProjectInitializer: rule and reflection scaffolding
  install-log.js      Shared versioned install target logging
  skills.js           SkillManager: platform skill installation
  agents.js           AgentManager: sub-agent registration
test/
  index.test.js       Unit tests for parser, mapper, skills, and CLI behavior
  platform-audit.js   Integration checks across supported platforms
```

### Pipeline

1. **File Scanning:** Recursively walks the directory while respecting nested `.gitignore` patterns.
2. **Context Extraction:** Scans for classes, functions, variables, and comments while stripping literals to reduce false matches.
3. **Graph Extraction:** Identifies imports, requires, extends, and implements edges.
4. **Tag Extraction:** Captures `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, and `DEPRECATED` tags from comments.
5. **Reflection Management:** Deduplicates and persists agent learnings into a standardized Markdown file.
6. **Compilation:** Writes a compact `llm-code-graph.md` file with capped descriptions, symbols, tags, and a dedicated `## EDGES` section.
